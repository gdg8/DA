Usage fairly self explanatory (at least once you've used it).

Non-intuitive bits include

Compare with School duties DB
*****************************

make comp

This compares this data with that in the DA dbase and shows the diffs
Output in form
<unit code>: Here: <d1: local staffing data> School: <d2: DA DB data> (In d1, not d2: In d2, not d1)

eg.
COMP61242: Here: BMGC,NPF	School: SBF (BMGC,NPF: SBF)

Changing Course unit codes.
***************************
cu-alias.csv
This is used when a course unit changes code, the format is

old code,new code

Using this has the side effect of creating new versions of
cu-staff.csv, cu-title.csv and cu-issues.csv. All located in the
reports directory/CSV. Once things have settled down, these files can
be slotted into place to replace the out of date ones in the data
directory and cu-alias.csv can then be removed. The shell script
switch-to-new-codes does this job for you, and creates backup versions
of the old files.
